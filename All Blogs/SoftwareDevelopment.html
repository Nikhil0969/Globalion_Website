                                        </h3>
                                        <p class="mb-4">Software testing helps determine if the actual software product
                                            meets the expectations and is free of defects before it is launched. It
                                            includes running the software or system components through their paces using
                                            automated or manual tools to evaluate the properties of interest. It
                                            verifies that a software product or application does what it’s supposed to
                                            do.
                                            Testing has many benefits, like preventing bugs, enhancing performance,
                                            reducing development costs, and increasing customer satisfaction. </p>

                                            Why is Software Testing Important?
                                        </h5>
                                        <p class="mb-4">Every software engineer believes in the power of testing. In
                                            fact, no one will argue against the need for immense quality control during
                                            the software development process. A late delivery or software defect can
                                            damage a brand’s reputation in the market and lead to disappointed, angry,
                                            and lost customers. In extreme cases, a defect can also degrade the
                                            interconnected systems leading to severe malfunctions.
                                            Software testers evaluate the code by questioning it at various stages. It
                                            can either be brief or proceed long until all the stakeholders are satisfied
                                            with the results. A software development company identifies bugs during
                                            testing along with other issues in the process. Then, engineers fix the
                                            issues before launch and ensure that only quality products are shared with
                                            customers, boosting satisfaction and trust.

                                            to a software glitch. All these could have been avoided if the software had
                                            been tested thoroughly. </p>

                                            annually if they invest in testing and QA processes. Early testing uncovers
                                            issues before the software product goes to market. As a result, the software

                                            includes:
                                            <br>
                                            • Defining the test environment

                                            • Analysing the test results

                                            • Preparing and submitting defect reports

                                            <br>

                                            Testing is often time-consuming, but it’s one of the most essential steps in
                                            a software engineering project. For small builds, manual or ad-hoc testing
                                            may be sufficient. But in the case of larger systems, companies need tools
                                            to automate tasks. Automated testing also helps teams implement various
                                            scenarios and quickly receive feedback on what works and what doesn’t. A
                                            solid testing approach includes the application programming interface (API),
                                            system levels and the UI. Also, the more tests are automated and run at an
                                            earlier stage, the better it is for the entire software development team.
