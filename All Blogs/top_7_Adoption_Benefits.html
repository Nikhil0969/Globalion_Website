                                        </h3>
                                        <p class="mb-4"> For most businesses, big or small, cloud computing is the new
                                            normal. In a digital age, with the growing remote workforce, moving to the
                                            cloud is often a common step for corporates. Its computing is based on the
                                            internet – accessible anytime, anywhere. Instead of running applications,
                                            programs or software on a physical system or server in a building, you can
                                            now access all applications and data using the internet. We’re already using
                                            the cloud in our daily lives – whether streaming on Netflix, checking bank
                                            balances on your phone, or browsing through Facebook and Instagram! </p>
                                        <p class="mb-md-5 mb-4">For small businesses, adopting cloud technology can
                                            solve many business challenges – sending emails on the go, using apps to
                                            reduce workload, enabling data access to team members, and more. We bring
                                            you the benefits of cloud computing in business to help you move faster and
                                            scale better:</p>

                                            1. Better Data Governance and Security
                                        </h5>
                                        <p class="mb-4">Small businesses must be able to match their large competitors
                                            in securing and respecting their customers’ privacy and data. A cloud-based
                                            service provider monitors security 24x7, which a small business can’t
                                            achieve without third-party support. Companies like Apple, Microsoft,
                                            Amazon, etc., have resources to mitigate, detect, and eliminate
                                            cybersecurity threats faster and better than small businesses can. </p>

                                            2. Lower IT Costs
                                        </h5>
                                        <p class="mb-4">For an SME, cost reduction is the key to running a successful
                                            long-term business. Since cloud adoption offers the option to pay as per
                                            your needs, it reduces expenses and promotes higher savings. You only need
                                            to spend on operational costs rather than worry about capital expenditure.
                                            The subscription-based model promises better cash flow and makes it easier
                                            to move to the cloud. Thus, cloud computing is beneficial for small and
                                            medium enterprises. </p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">Cloud computing is the one-stop solution for growing bandwidth
                                            demands. You can quickly scale up your capacity using remote servers or even
                                            scale down when there’s a decrease in sales. This kind of flexibility offers
                                            a competitive edge in the market as it helps you enhance your overall
                                            operational efficiency.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">Loss of data can be challenging for any small business. Apart
                                            from the loss of files, the time and money spent on recovery can be huge. As
                                            per CloudRadar, the cost of network downtime can be more than $10,000 per
                                            hour. Investing in data recovery can be troublesome for a small business.
                                            With the expertise and scale of cloud-based solutions, data recovery is
                                            quick for all kinds of disasters, even if it’s wiping data from a lost
                                            laptop! Cloud companies offer a sense of resilience against challenging

                                        <p class="mb-4">Since your servers are off-premise, a third party will handle
                                            all the regular system updates. Did you know cloud adoption can reduce IT
                                            maintenance costs by 16.79%? The budget can be used to design and develop
                                            better market-differentiating solutions! You also don’t need to buy
                                            up-to-date equipment every few years, and as a result, you enjoy complete
                                            peace of mind. If your business is getting off the ground, this is an
                                            excellent advantage as you won’t need extra human resources for equipment

                                            7. Greater Competitive Advantage
                                        </h5>
                                        <p class="mb-4">More than 75% of customers expect companies to embrace new
                                            technologies and deliver better experiences. As a result, when you move to
                                            the cloud, you can disrupt the market while remaining lean. This advantage
                                            can give you the competitive edge you’re looking for as a small business.
                                            You can now match the big and established business houses with high-end
                                            enterprise technology by your side!</p>
